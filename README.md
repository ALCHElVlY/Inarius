<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Hello, and let me first start off by thanking you for taking the time to explore one of my first JavaScript applications. A little background on my love for Diablo II/Resurrected. I grew up on the game, started playing back in 2005, randomly picked it up from a friend who didn't even know what the game was, and as a result never played it. After my first playthough on singleplayer as a barb, hacking and slashing my way through Act1 normal, I fell in love. Played the game off and on ever since, picking it up again randomly when I was bored and hadn't played for years. Then the news regarding the remake came out, old passions re-ignited! I only recently started getting into programming, small projects, mostly Discord bots so nothing major (yet!), but decided to further my passion and pursue higher education as a Software Developer, my goal is to be a Full Stack Developer. being able to combine both passions of D2R, and programming is truly a blessing, and I hope anyone that give Inarius a try truly enjoys what the bot can bring to your Discord server.
    - Cheers, Alchemy

* Various commands for cube recipes, runewords, item stats, and more!
