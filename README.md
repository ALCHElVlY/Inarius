<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Hello, and let me first start off by thanking you for taking the time to explore one of my applications. I enjoy video games such as Diablo II: Resurrected, and I love that Discord gives us the ability to organize great communities. I also enjoying programming so it brings me great pleasure to bring a program to other players of the game that will help them in their day to day's by automating as many tasks as humanly possible. I hope the bot project grows so that anyone and everyone playing the game can enjoy it to its fullest.

Inarius comes equipped with the following:
