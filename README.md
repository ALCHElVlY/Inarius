<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The idea and design that went into making the Inarius Discord bot was that it could bring a Diablo II database to a server, as well as additional moderation modules to help assist the server owner in protecting his/her Discord server. The application has alot to bring to any one Discord, especially for the Diablo II fanatic.

Inarius comes equipped with the following:
* Various commands for cube recipes, runewords, item stats, and more!
* Keep track of Diablo Clone walks and soj's sold
* Light-weight moderation modules (authorized links, profanity filter, etc).
* Fully themed around Diablo lore.
* Customizable welcome messages, with a Diablo II themed join/leave image.
* Stay up to date with Diablo II news & updates with its built in RSS feed reader.



## Built With

Here are any frameworks/libraries used in the bot's development.
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/)
