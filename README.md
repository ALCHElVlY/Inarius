<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The idea and design that went into making the Inarius Discord bot was that it could bring a Diablo II database to a Discord server, as well as additional moderation modules to help assist the server owner in protecting it from scammers, and spam bots. The application has alot to bring to any one Discord, especially for the Diablo II fanatic.

Inarius comes equipped with the following:
* Various commands for cube recipes, runewords, item stats, and more!
* Keep track of Diablo Clone walks and soj's sold
* Light-weight moderation modules (authorized links, profanity filter, etc).
* Fully themed around Diablo lore.
* Customizable welcome messages, with a Diablo II themed join/leave image.
* Stay up to date with Diablo II news & updates with its built in RSS feed reader.
* Has useful API integrations for everything your Diablo II: Resurrected Discord server could ever ask for!



## Built With

Here are any frameworks/libraries used in the bot's development.
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/)
